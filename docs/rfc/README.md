# RFCs for jk

This directory contains "request for comment" documents, or RFCs. An
RFC here describes a self-contained design for a part of `jk`, e.g., a
feature of the runtime, or a module in the standard library.

All the RFCs that have been merged (i.e., appear in this directory in
`master` branch) represent accepted proposals. They may or may not be
implemented in `jk`, and they may or may not be out of date (i.e., no
longer relevant, or no longer congruent with other parts of `jk`).

## Process

To be determined; but for now, an approved PR that adds a file here is
enough.
