# List of std library deprecations

## Deprecated in 0.4.x (will be changed in 0.5.0)

### Special case for default input directory

In most cases, the input directory will be the current directory if
not explicitly set with `--input-directory`.

However, there is a special case: if the script being run is from the
filesystem, the input directory will be set to the directory
containing the script.

This special case is deprecated. From 0.5.0, the input directory will
_always default to the current working directory_ unless explicitly
set with `--input-directory`.

## Deprecated in 0.3.x (will be removed in 0.4.0)

### `generate` file property is now called path

The `file` property in the array of objects consumed by `jk generate` is
deprecated in favour of the `path` property. Both names still work.

**Deprecated**

```
const object = {
  message: 'success',
};

export default [
  { file: 'object0.yaml', value: object },
];
```

**Use**:

```
export default [
  { path: 'object0.yaml', value: object },
];
```

## Deprecated in 0.2.x (will be removed in 0.3.0)

### merge, patch and mix std functions

*Deprecated in 0.2.10*

The `merge` and `patch` functions of the `@jkcfg/std/merge` module have been
deprecated in favour of the more general `mergeFull` function.

The `mix` function has been deprecated to be redefined a bit later. Composing
merge operations is definitely useful but we'd like to think a bit more about
it.

- `merge` and `patch` will be removed in `0.3.0`.
- `mergeFull` will be renamed to `merge` in `0.3.0`.
- `mix` will be removed in `0.3.0`.

### std import

*Deprecated in 0.2.5*

We have decided the std library should be imported from `'@jkcfg/std'`:

- It lets us write a node.js shim at a later point that replicates the
  stdlib functionality for use in unit tests.
- We publish typescript typings in this package, `tsc` will pick up those
  definitions automatically as well as IDEs.

We also decided to [not use `export default`](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/tips/defaultIsBad.html).

**Deprecated**:

```js
import std from 'std';
import std from '@jkcfg/std';
```

**Use:**

```js
import * as std from '@jkcfg/std';
```

or for specific functions:

```js
import { log } from '@jkcfg/std';
```

This command can be used to help porting existing code over:

```
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*node_modules*" -prune | \
  xargs sed -i -e "s#import std from 'std';#import * as std from '@jkcfg/std';#"
```

### std sub-modules

*Deprecated in 0.2.5*

`jk` can now use fine grained modules in its standard library. We have split out:

- '@jkcfg/std/param'
- '@jkcfg/std/fs'

**Deprecated**

```js
import { param, dir, info }  as std from '@jkcfg/std';
```

**Use:**

```js
import * as param from '@jkcfg/std/param';
import { dir, info } from '@jkcfg/std/fs';
```
